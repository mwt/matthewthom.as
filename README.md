This is my personal website. It is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is based off [indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). Pages are build and hosted by [vercel](https://vercel.com). The PDF version of my resume is automatically generated from [resume.md](resume.md) on each build using [vTeX](https://github.com/mwt/vtex).

The scripts to install dependencies and build the site can be found in the `.github/scripts` folder.
