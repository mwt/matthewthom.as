Agents with similar skill may differ in their ability to self-promote. We consider the problem of a manager who uses an efficient, anonymous contest to extract effort from equally productive workers who differ in their ability to win the contest. If the prize is fixed, it is often possible to discriminate against the stronger player despite anonymity. However, full surplus extraction is not typically possible. If the designer can endogenize the prize, full surplus extraction is possible in an all-pay auction as long as a single-crossing condition is met. In the optimal contest, the worker with the better self-promotion technology is endogenously offered a lower expected prize. Because the contest is anonymous, this discrimination is *covert*.
