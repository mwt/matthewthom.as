When workers' hours and wages are bargained jointly, workers may not receive their preferred hours for their wage. This paper studies labor market regulation when it is known that workers prefer to work fewer hours (are overworked), but specific knowledge of production, labor disutility, and bargaining protocol is absent. We show that for a large class of bargaining protocols, there is regulation that robustly increases worker utility without sacrificing total surplus. We use this model to motivate the overtime pay provision of 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act as a robust Pareto improvement over a simple cap on hours.
