Agents with similar skill may differ in their ability to self-promote. We consider the problem of a contest designer who intends to motivate equally productive workers who differ in their ability to win the contest. Full surplus extraction is always possible if the contest can be "unfair" in the sense that it (1) is not anonymous or (2) sometimes fails to award the prize. If the prize is fixed, the optimal contest is an all-pay auction with bid caps. If the designer is allowed to make the prize endogenous, full surplus extraction is possible in an all-pay auction so long as the marginal self-promotion abilities are not fully ranked. In the optimal contest, the player with the better self promotion technology is endogenously offered a lower prize in expectation. Because the contest is symmetric, this discrimination is *covert*.
