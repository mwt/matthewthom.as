When opposing parties compete for a  prize, the sunk effort players exert during the conflict can affect the value of the winner's reward. These *spillovers* can have substantial influence on the equilibrium behavior of participants in applications such as lobbying, warfare, labor tournaments, marketing, and R&D races. To understand this influence, we study a general class of asymmetric, two-player all-pay auctions where we allow for spillovers in each player's reward.  The link between participants' efforts and rewards yields novel effects -- in particular, players with higher costs and lower values than their opponent sometimes extract larger payoffs.
