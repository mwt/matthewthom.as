We show that any efficient two-player symmetric allocation rule between risk neutral, heterogeneous players generates weakly less revenue than one of two contests. The revenue maximizing symmetric, efficient contest is an all-pay auction with bid caps when heterogeneity is low and a difference form contest when heterogeneity is high. If the contest may be either inefficient or asymmetric, even at a single point, full surplus extraction is possible.
