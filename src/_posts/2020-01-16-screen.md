## Basic usage

### Single terminal

To launch screen, just run

~~~ sh
screen
~~~

Then run all of your commands like ``stata -b do filename``. When you want to "minimize" the terminal, just press **Ctrl+A** followed by the **D** key. 

You can then safely log out of ssh without killing the precess that you ran.

~~~ sh
exit
~~~

When ``ssh`` back into the server, you can check back on the process by running

~~~ sh
screen -r
~~~

This will reopen the terminal that you just closed.

### Using tabs
You can create a new tab inside of a screen by pressing **Ctrl+A** followed by the **C** key. You will then have a tab 0 and a tab 1. 

You can swap between tabs by pressing **Ctrl+A** followed by **Shift+'** (actually **Shift+"**). 

You can close a tab by pressing **Ctrl+D** or just running ``exit``.

## Managing multiple screens
You can create a second screen by running

~~~ sh
screen
~~~

you can list all open screens by running

~~~ sh
screen -list
~~~

~~~ shell_session
There are screens on:
	2239.tty.host	(Detached)
	2044.tty.host	(Detached)
	22287.tty.host	(Detached)
3 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-user.
~~~

You can specify which screen you want to connect to using the name from the list.

~~~ sh
screen -r 2044.tty.host
~~~

The pid (the number part) is also sufficient

~~~ sh
screen -r 2044
~~~

You can close a screen using **Ctrl+D**
