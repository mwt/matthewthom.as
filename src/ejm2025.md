I share to provide an accurate landing page before it gets posted on <abbr title="Job Openings for Economists">JOE</abbr> and [the FTC careers page](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/careers). I just wanted you to be able to find it! If you have questions about applying, you can reach out to [me](/){rel=author} or the contacts in the announcement: [James Thomas](https://jamesrobinsonthomas.com/) and [Viola Chen](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/viola-chen).

The position is open field. I'm a microeconomic theorist; we have economists in labor, health, urban, industrial organizational, education, behavioral, and more. Many fields are relevant to the antitrust and consumer protection missions of the FTC.

Please share widely! I'm really excited that we are hiring. I think everyone is. There are also posts on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattwthomas_the-federal-trade-commission-is-hiring-phd-activity-7402087914245095424-6yoT){target=_blank}, [Mastodon](https://econtwitter.net/@mwt/115657592833660589){target=_blank}, and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/matthewthom.as/post/3m74diugujs2a){target=_blank} that would be helpful to share.
